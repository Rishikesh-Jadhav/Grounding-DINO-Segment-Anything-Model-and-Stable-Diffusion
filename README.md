# Grounding-DINO-Segment-Anything-Model-and-Stable-Diffusion
Follwoing is a project to combine Grounding DINO for zero-shot object detection with Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM) for semantic segmentation and finally Stable Diffusion for inpainting the input image . The gaol of the project wast to integrate these techniques and deploy the model on Hugging Face with a Gradio interface for users to detect, segment regions and inpaint them in images. 
NOTE: This application works best for image swith the resolution of 512x512 for images with a higher reolution the inapinting quality drops substantially.
