# Segment-Anything-Model-and-Stable-Diffusion
Starting a new project to combine Stable Diffusion, with Facebook's Segment Anything Model (SAM) for semantic segmentation. The plan is to integrate these techniques and deploy the model on Hugging Face with a Gradio interface for users to segment regions and inpaint them in images.
